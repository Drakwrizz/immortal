This is a binary file that when executed, cannot be removed from the computer before a reboot.<br />
It has no other goal than that.<br />
If you find a way to remove it feel free to post a github issue.<br />
It currently only work on linux machine.<br /><br /><br /><br />
The code takes the binary file and monitors it. <br />
If the binary file is removed, a process rebuilds it. <br />
This process is totally unkillable regardless of the user's permission. <br />
This file does not require any permission to be executed or run.<br />
